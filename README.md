# Python package with extra tools to use for data science.

Welcome to `extra-datascience-tools`, a Python package which offers addition tools for data scientists. These tools include or will include e.g.:
- functions
- classes
- decorators
- graphs

which are useful and often used for most data science projects, so that you don't need to rewrite the same code over again or invent it yourself. Please be aware that this package was launched in oktober 2022 and thus the current amount of features might be limited, but the features that are present can be of great use.


## About
