      # Install Poetry. You could do this manually, or there are several actions that do this.
      # `snok/install-poetry` seems to be minimal yet complete, and really just calls out to
      # Poetry's default install script, which feels correct. I pin the Poetry version here
      # because Poetry does occasionally change APIs between versions and I don't want my
      # actions to break if it does.

      # venv as a `.venv` in your testing directory, which allows the next step to easily
      # cache it.
